    "# Lake model\n",
    "\n",
    "see also [this general introduction to the workbench](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2017/11/01/using-the-exploratory-modelling-workbench/) as a source of inspiration for completing the assignment below\n",
    "\n",
    "## the lake model\n",
    "The exploratory modeling workbench includes an example folder. This folder contains a variety of examples that demonstrate the functionality of the workbench. Many of these examples have been drawn from published cases. Here, we use the Lake Problem as an example for demonstrating some of the key functionality of the workbench. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate some of the key capabilities of the exploratory modeling workbench using the Lake problem. The lake problem is a stylized and hypothetical decision problem where the population of a city has to decide on the amount of annual pollution it will put into a lake. It the pollution in the lake passes a threshold, it will suffer irreversible eutrophication. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    X_{(t+1)}=X_t+a_t+\\frac{(X_t^q)}{(1+X_t^q )}- bX_t+\\epsilon_t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_t$ is the pollution at time $t$, $a_t$ is the rate of anthropogenic pollution at time $t$, $b$ is the lake’s natural removal rate, $q$ is the lake's natural recycling rate, $\\epsilon_t$ is the rate of natural pollution at time $t$. The rate of anthropogenic pollution $a_t$ is the decision variable and is somewhere between 0, and 0.1. So $a_t \\in [0,0.1]$. The natural pollution $\\epsilon_t$ is modeled, following Singh et al. (2015), as a log normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. \n",
    "There are four outcomes of interest. The first is the average concentration of phosphor in the lake. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_{phosphorus}=  \\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert} \\sum\\limits_{t\\in{T}} X_t \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert$ is the cardinality of the set of points in time. \n",
    "The second objective is the economic benefit derived from polluting the lake. Following Singh et al. (2015), this is defined as the discounted benefit of pollution mines the costs of having a polluted lake\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_{economic} = \\sum\\limits_{t \\in {T}}\\alpha a_t \\delta^t \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the utility derived from polluting and $\\delta$ is the discount rate. By default, $\\alpha$ is 0.04.\n",
    "The third objective is related to the year over year change in the anthropogenic pollution rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_{inertia} =\\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert-1} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert} I(|a_{t}-a_{t-1} |>\\tau)   \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I$ is an indicator function that is 0 if the statement is false, and 1 if the statement is true, $\\tau$ is the threshold that is deemed undesirable, and is for illustrative purposes et to 0.2. Effectively, f_{inertia} is the fraction of years where the absolute value of the change in anthropogenic pollution is larger then $\\tau$.\n",
    "The fourth objective is the fraction of years where the pollution in the lake is below the critical threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_{reliability} =  \\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert} \\sum\\limits_{t \\in T}I(X_{t}<X_{crit} ) \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I$ is an indicator function that is 0 if the statement is false, and 1 if the statement is true, $X_{crit}$ is the critical threshold of pollution and is a function of both $b$ and $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lake problem is characterized by both stochastic uncertainty and deep uncertainty. The stochastic uncertainty arises from the natural inflow. To reduce this stochastic uncertainty, multiple replications are performed and the average over the replication is taken. Deep uncertainty is presented by uncertainty about the mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $sigma$ of the lognormal distribution characterizing the natural inflow, the natural removal rate of the lake $\\beta$, the natural recycling rate of the lake $q$, and the discount rate $\\delta$. The table below specifies the ranges for the deeply uncertain factors, as well as their best estimate or default values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "1. Given the Python implementation of the lake problem in lakemodel_function.py, adapt this code and connect it to the workbench\n",
    "\n",
    "for the uncertainties, use the following table\n",
    "\n",
    "|Parameter\t|Range\t        |Default value|\n",
    "|-----------|--------------:|------------:|\n",
    "|$\\mu$    \t|0.01 – 0.05\t|0.02         |\n",
    "|$\\sigma$\t|0.001 – 0.005 \t|0.0017       |\n",
    "|$b$      \t|0.1 – 0.45\t    |0.42         |\n",
    "|$q$\t    |2 – 4.5\t    |2            |\n",
    "|$\\delta$\t|0.93 – 0.99\t|0.98         |\n",
